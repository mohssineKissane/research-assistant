                        "According to the context, concerns about AI and automation include the fear of losing jobs due to automation, with a predicted loss of 85 million jobs by 2025 [1, no page number available]. Additionally, there is a concern that as machines become smarter, they may become opinionated and biased like their human trainers [1, no page number available]. Another concern is that AI might replace jobs, although it may also create new ones [Source: https://hackernoon.com/artificial-intelligence-and-big-data-zys3258, no page number available].\n",
